Description: This package provides an tractable algorithm for building a 
    multinomial logistic regression model with the model proposed in 
    [Wen et al. (2020)]. The proposed method combines the merits of rank 
    reduction and variable selection, constructing a parameter matrix with row 
    sparsity and low-rank. Four other baseline methods are also included for
    comparison (grouped/ungrouped multinomial lasso [Simon et al. (2013)]; 
    NNET [Ripley et al. (2016)]; RRVGLM [Yee and Hastie (2003)]). As a 
    representative example, the HAM10000 dataset is included as well. See 
    'Simultaneous Dimension Reduction and Variable Selection for Multinomial 
    Logistic Regression' for further information of this algorithm and related 
    backgrounds.
